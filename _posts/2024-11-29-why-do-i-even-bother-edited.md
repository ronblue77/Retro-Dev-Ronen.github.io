**"You can write poems all you want. You can learn to code all you want. You can try to do anything you wish with your time. But it's meaningless. The world will look at you and only see a 'schizo,' a mentally ill, worthless piece of human trash. That’s all you can ever be in this world."**  
– *Danny, 2009*

Sometimes I wake up in the morning and ask myself: why do I even bother? Usually, I just go back to sleep until the afternoon.

For 14 years (or was it 17?), I wrote poetry and tried to publish it. Why? Because I was naive enough to believe someone cared about me—about my stupid poems or books. The same goes for coding. I studied hard for seven or eight years to learn how to create games and chatbots (before ChatGPT gave everyone instant answers). I thought that if I could bring my dumb dreams to life, someone might notice me, value me, or even want to be my friend.

I wasted my time and my life interacting with scammers and creeps online, all to learn how to code. Now, I ask myself: was it worth it? Was it worth chasing dreams in a world that couldn’t care less about me?

This world doesn’t want me. It wants me homeless, mentally ill, and dying in the streets—freezing to death or jumping off a bridge. "Nobody loves you when you're down and out; nobody sees you when you're old and gray. Everybody loves you when you're six feet underground."  
– *John Lennon*

This world doesn’t care about me. This world doesn’t need me. This world doesn’t want me.

I've spent most of my life carrying the stigma of mental illness—rejected, abandoned, and treated like a stray dog by everyone. I might not be homeless (yet), but socially, I’m dead. Isolated. All I’ve learned from this world is how to hate myself, how to endure abuse, and how to live with trauma. I’ve been taught that good people don’t exist.

Computer programming? Poetry? Forget it. Let AI generate your soulless "culture" of porn and consumerism. Then wonder why you hate yourself and your life.

I had a few friends when I was young, but they weren’t real friends. They were just "playing me." No true love. No real connections. No family. Nothing. A complete waste of a life.

And when you reach your 30s or 40s, you rush to "fix" everything, to make something of yourself, only to find out it’s too late. The gates are closed. You’re doomed. No salvation. No recovery. No miracles. No kindness, love, or compassion. Just abuse, cruelty, and the wreckage of a lost soul.

This is my site. This is my blog. I can post whatever I want here—but nobody is listening anyway.

Honestly, the internet only makes it worse. Maybe I would’ve been better off if it had never been invented. Social media, forums, and online communities have only deepened my isolation.

Why do I even bother? Like, who cares? Think about it—why do *you* even bother? Nobody cares about you, either. That’s the truth. The only difference is that most people bury their egos so deep they can’t see it. They think they’re "special," "unique," or "one of a kind." They think they’re God’s gift to the universe, entitled to "rights." But it’s all bullshit. Their self-delusion is endless.

As for me, I know there are no such things as "rights." There are only privileges—temporary, fragile privileges that can be stripped away in an instant. One day, you’re a person. The next, you’re a social outcast, a prisoner, or a homeless nobody with nothing but the clothes on your back. The future is grim: aging, getting sick, dying in a world that doesn’t care about you or outright hates you.

I don’t even care to remember the people I met online—the narcissists, egotists, and psychopaths from chat rooms, forums, and social media. They’re the reason I’d rather talk to AI than deal with real humans. Real people are the devil to me.

So, why did I start writing poetry? Why did I learn programming? Why do I even bother?

The answer is simple: when life crushes you, when fate stomps on you and destroys who you were, you have to find a way to survive. You pick yourself up by any means necessary and reinvent yourself.

Poetry and programming were my way of surviving in a world that erased my identity and left me at a dead end. They were instinctual—like a man grasping a branch to stop himself from falling. At the start, my poetry and programming were pure, sincere, and innocent.

But when I started seeking validation from the world, everything changed. The world’s fakeness corrupted it all. People showed me their true nature: cruelty and indifference.

Maybe I’ll write more in another post. Let’s see how I feel tomorrow.
