i live in Protected Housing for almost as long as i remember. (20 years plus)...

whats protected housing like? in a clean term it's a group home for people with mental illness learning to be rehabilitated back to live free in society BUT in reality it's like a little psycho ward prison in "the community" (a community that don't want us here)...

how it's like living in Protected Housing? (i think the "Protected" part is kinda sick joke as nothing can be more further then the truth) "Imagine Life as a Convict that's getting old" (_2Pac_) or in other words while "normal people" get to build and live their lives we "the locos" get to live more like the movie "***One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest***" from 1975 or in other words "EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL ABUSE" proteced housing is good for nothig and what is left from it today is just a threat to be thrown to the streets if you don't obey the rules and even if you do eventually they'll tell you "time's up" and send you outside (get rid of you) to live on your own (hopefully is some shit place of your own and not on the streets)

20 years ago they used to get you in give you a room of your own and tell you something like "welcome! relax! this is your home!" today they are in the process of closing down all protected housing and group homes cause there is no profit in it so the bullshit word "**Rehabilitation**" is it the center of the staff who run the housing...

**Rehabilitation** is **A Bullshit Word** it always was it always will be it's a polite way to keep you in for 20 plus years ruine your life abuse you then when you got no family or anyone left outside and it's not profitable to keep you in they SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY to fuck off and get rid of you... you are just **a schitzo** a processed industrial meat in a production line - what happens to you after nobody cares...

meanwhile "normal people" get married have kids graduate college get hired and get promoted see their kids graduate and leave home or in other words "they have A LIFE" while you in your fucked up protected housing get abused day by day by your criminally insane roommates

in the end after so much time "you got to live with it" you have no choice... since the choice was made for you long time ago (by family or doctors or social workers or somebody)

time can build you up or destroy you time is no healer...
