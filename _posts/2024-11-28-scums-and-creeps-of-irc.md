### Scums and Creeps of IRC

There are only two modes of social interaction between me and other people in the real world or online.

1. Abuse mode – a mode where others abuse me emotionally or mentally, humiliate me, mock me, curse at me, threaten me, cheat me, lie to me, pretend to be friends and care only to get close enough to stick a blade in my back or heart and leave with a devilish evil smile on their face.

2. A state of ignoring – total ignoring as if I am transparent, lack of care and consideration as if I do not exist, complete denial that I have feelings or that I need help or compassion or a kind word and using me as an object or tool to achieve something without any care or remorse and ignoring me and my needs

This is how it is on IRC or Discord or Facebook or in general in the entire network and the virtual world and also in real life because what happens in the online world permeates and affects real life in the real world -

In general in every interaction between me and other people – no one is interested in you and yo do not care who I really am, it is not interesting to anyone, all that people are interested in is how and what you say, how you present yourself and how you look and how you sound to them – in other words, no one reads the book, all that they are interested in is what its cover looks like…

The more time I spend in chat rooms and channels both on Discord or IRC, the more I hate people and become a misanthrope – no one cares at all – The internet is death to the soul and mind, slowly the type of interaction there with people will screw up your brain and intellect…

In recent years, most chat room users have been going to Discord and abandoning IRC, so let's talk about the scum that remained on IRC:

1. Neo-Nazis

2. Satanists and members of various cults

3. Hackers

4. Sexual perverts

5. Trolls

6. Lonely people with mental problems

7. Religious or atheist people

8. Programmers who have no life

9. Drug addicts and drug dealers

These are basically the subgroups that stayed on IRC and they are there because they are so screwed up that they have no other place to be and the IRC platform is already about 25-30 years old? Something like that? So all the old people over 30-40 stayed there while the young gamers go to Discord they think it's better and don't understand that it's the same shit...

I'll give just one example so you can see how much shit is on IRC

I'm in a mental health support room that I opened and it's just me and two others there – I know them well. I've already spent dozens of hours with them in this chat room and in other channels on IRC. One of them has already come out to say that he has depression and is diagnosed with a mental illness after a suicide attempt and that he was a hacker (!)

So in short, that hacker suddenly out of nowhere asks me "Tell me when you dye your hair?" And I immediately start to get paranoid that the same (former?) hacker broke into my computer out of boredom and is now seeing me through my webcam – I ask him what the hell he’s talking about?

“Oops sorry I was on the wrong chat channel I meant someone else on another channel” he laughs to himself and there’s a smiley face laughing

I block him and throw him out of the chat room but the paranoia is working overtime and it’s too late…

You can’t be sure of anything on the internet! Nothing! And all those mental health or support chat rooms are one big bluff there is no mental support anywhere on the internet! At least not for me.

### The internet is a place of one big ABUSE!!! Remember that!
