title: "Protected Housing Blues"

I’ve been living in protected housing for as long as I can remember—over 20 years now.

What’s protected housing like? In theory, it’s a group home for people with mental illness, designed to help them rehabilitate and reintegrate into society. But in reality, it feels more like a small psychiatric prison disguised as "community living"—a community that doesn’t want us here in the first place.

What’s it like living in protected housing? Honestly, the term “protected” feels like a cruel joke—it couldn’t be further from the truth. Imagine life as an aging convict, as 2Pac once put it. While "normal people" get to build lives, families, and careers, we—the so-called "crazies"—exist in a world closer to *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.* It’s a life filled with emotional and mental abuse.

Protected housing today is little more than a holding pen. It’s a place where the unspoken threat of being thrown out onto the streets looms over you daily. Even if you follow the rules, they eventually tell you, “Time’s up,” and send you on your way—usually to some subpar, low-quality housing if you’re lucky, or the streets if you’re not.

Twenty years ago, when I first arrived, they gave you your own room and welcomed you with something like, “This is your home. Relax!” It felt, at least for a moment, like a safe haven. But times have changed. Protected housing and group homes are being systematically shut down because there’s no profit in keeping them open. The focus has shifted to “rehabilitation”—a buzzword that sounds good on paper but means nothing in practice.

**Rehabilitation** is a lie. It always has been, and it always will be. It’s a polite way to justify keeping people institutionalized for decades, ruining their lives and cutting them off from family and the outside world. And when it’s no longer profitable to keep you, they kick you out, leaving you to fend for yourself. You’re no longer a person in their eyes—just another “schizo,” discarded like factory waste from an industrial process.

What happens to you after that? Nobody cares.

Meanwhile, “normal people” get married, have children, graduate from college, build careers, and watch their kids grow up and leave home. They have lives. But in protected housing, you’re stuck in a perpetual cycle of day-to-day abuse—often at the hands of your roommates, who are just as troubled as you are.

After so many years, you’re forced to accept it. You have no choice, because the choice was made for you long ago—by your family, doctors, social workers, or someone else who decided your fate.

Time can build you up, or it can destroy you. But one thing’s for sure: time is no healer.
