Hi again,

Remember the saying by Louis CK? “Everything is awesome—nobody’s happy”?

That’s how I feel these days... or for the past few years, ever since I became “present online.” It seems like people don’t care about anything or anyone except themselves.

You can’t find a TRUE friend—not online at least. Not in online chats, not in forums, not in communities. Especially when you DON’T HIDE the fact that you have a mental illness. People hate that and hate you automatically. I can’t count the number of times I’ve been looked down on, lectured, trolled, condescended to, or outright abused just for being me. They never forgive your mistakes, judge you for them, ruin your name, and think so highly of themselves while feeling righteous. They’ll never see the good you’re trying to do. They’ll hardly ever help when you ask a “dumb question” or seek understanding. Sure, they’ll throw you a bone to feel good about themselves, but afterward, they’ll kick you like a dog.

Sooner or later, they’ll start ignoring you, gossiping about you, banning you, and speaking about you—but not with you. They’ll say how “messed up” you are, laughing in your face with their perfect English, tearing you apart with every remark. They think they’re perfect, and to them, you’re just scum—a punching bag they can take their frustrations out on. And who cares, right? ABUSE CULTURE or CANCEL CULTURE—call it what you want—that’s the reality of online “communities.”

The next level of this nightmare is when they try to find and hurt you in any way they can. Strangers start harassing you, sending nasty comments. Then it escalates—you realize you have HATERS on your tail. Faceless bad guys from the darknet send you scam mail, spam, phishing emails, hate messages, or even death threats. You realize you’ve become a TARGET. Somebody really hates you or what you do, and you don’t even know who they are.

In the long run, you end up with HATERS everywhere, ignored or banned from every place you once participated in online. The forums or sites you’ve created become ghost towns visited only by spambots and hackers. Nobody wants anything to do with you anymore. No one trusts you because they believe the haters, not you. They see you as a freak, a lost mentally ill basket case to pity—a joke, a fool, or an a**hole. The first thing they destroy is your name, and then they keep trying to destroy you further by any means.

The so-called “good people” run from you like you’re a plague—just like “normal people” avoid or walk away from a homeless, mentally ill person on the street.

And the “bad people,” like sharks smelling blood, circle around, trying to devour you.

In conclusion, I know what it feels like to be CANCELLED by everyone—online and offline. And I know I’m not the only one. We are the silenced victims of modern times and social media. We are the shadow-banned by society.

There are three ways to deal with this:

1. Stay safe offline: Live offline, use Tails OS for surfing, cut ties with everyone, don’t trust anyone, and stick to yourself.
2. Build your own space: Create a site, forum, or community on the web to offer others a “safe place” away from toxic, abusive online behavior.
3. Stop worrying and focus on yourself: Let the haters hate, let the players play, and do what you believe is right for you.

Just remember: **“The more they hate you, the more you’re onto something.”**
