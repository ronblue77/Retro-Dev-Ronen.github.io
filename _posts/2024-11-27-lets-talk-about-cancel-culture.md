hi again...

:/ remember the saying of Louis CK ? "everything is awesome - nobody's happy"?

that's how i feel these days... or for last years since i became "presence online" it seems like people don't care about anything or about anyone except for themselves...

you won't be able to find a TRUE friend not online at least not in online chats not in online forums not in online communities... especially when you DON'T HIDE the fact you have a mental illness... people hate that and hate you automatically... i don't count the many times i was looked down or schooled or trolled or condencented or strightforward abused just for being me - they will never forgive your mistake and judge you by them ruine your name while thinking high and mighty of themselves feeling so rightous they'll never see the good you are trying to do they'll hardly never will help you when you ask a "dumb question" or look for someone to understand you - sure they will throw you some bone just to feel good about themselves and afterwords they'll kick you like a dog

sooner or later they'll start ignoring you gossiping about you banning you speaking about you but not with you saying just how "fucked up" you are laughing at your face with their perfect english destroying you with every remark they make - they think they are perfect and you are just a scum to them a punch bag they can take it out on you - and who cares right? ABUSE CULTURE or CANCEL CULTURE call it what you want that's the truth about online "communities"

the next level of this shit is - when they seek to find you and hurt you in any way they can... you start to be harrased by strangers you get nasty remarks and then you get it that YOU GOT HATERS ON YOUR TAIL some faceless bad guys from the darknet sending you scam mail spam and fishing mail or sending you hate mails or death threts mails and you realized that you ARE A TARGET online that somebody really hates you or the things you do and you don't even know who they are...

in the long run you just have HATERS everywhere and you are ignored/banned everywhere you once where online... and the places you opened like a forum or a site are ghost ships that no one visits except spambots and hackers nobody wants anything to do with you anymore no one trust you anymore cause they believe the haters not you they see you as a freak a lost mentally ill basket case that you should pity him a joke a fool or an a*shole - they first thing they destroy is your name after that they continue to try and destroy you further by all means...

so the "good people" run from you like from a plague or just like any "normal people" ignore or walk away when they see a homeless mentally ill person on the street

and the "bad people" like sharks smelling blood in the water come trying to eat you alive...

so in conclution i know what it feels like to be CANCELLED by everyone either online or offline - and i'm not the only one - we are the silenced victims of modern times and of social media - we are the shadow banned by society -

there are three ways to deal with this crap...

1. stay safe offline and live offline use tails OS for surfing cut ties with everyone and don't trust anyone and don't believe anyone stick to yourself...

2. try and open your own site/forum/communnity on the web to offer others a "safe place" from toxic abusive online people

3. stop worrying and just do your own thing let the haters hate and the players play and sit and do what you believe to be right for you... 

just remember "the more they hate you - the more you are right about something"

MORE ON THAT IN THE NEXT POST...

Hi again,

Remember the saying by Louis CK? “Everything is awesome—nobody’s happy”?

That’s how I feel these days... or for the past few years, ever since I became “present online.” It seems like people don’t care about anything or anyone except themselves.

You can’t find a TRUE friend—not online at least. Not in online chats, not in forums, not in communities. Especially when you DON’T HIDE the fact that you have a mental illness. People hate that and hate you automatically. I can’t count the number of times I’ve been looked down on, lectured, trolled, condescended to, or outright abused just for being me. They never forgive your mistakes, judge you for them, ruin your name, and think so highly of themselves while feeling righteous. They’ll never see the good you’re trying to do. They’ll hardly ever help when you ask a “dumb question” or seek understanding. Sure, they’ll throw you a bone to feel good about themselves, but afterward, they’ll kick you like a dog.

Sooner or later, they’ll start ignoring you, gossiping about you, banning you, and speaking about you—but not with you. They’ll say how “messed up” you are, laughing in your face with their perfect English, tearing you apart with every remark. They think they’re perfect, and to them, you’re just scum—a punching bag they can take their frustrations out on. And who cares, right? ABUSE CULTURE or CANCEL CULTURE—call it what you want—that’s the reality of online “communities.”

The next level of this nightmare is when they try to find and hurt you in any way they can. Strangers start harassing you, sending nasty comments. Then it escalates—you realize you have HATERS on your tail. Faceless bad guys from the darknet send you scam mail, spam, phishing emails, hate messages, or even death threats. You realize you’ve become a TARGET. Somebody really hates you or what you do, and you don’t even know who they are.

In the long run, you end up with HATERS everywhere, ignored or banned from every place you once participated in online. The forums or sites you’ve created become ghost towns visited only by spambots and hackers. Nobody wants anything to do with you anymore. No one trusts you because they believe the haters, not you. They see you as a freak, a lost mentally ill basket case to pity—a joke, a fool, or an a**hole. The first thing they destroy is your name, and then they keep trying to destroy you further by any means.

The so-called “good people” run from you like you’re a plague—just like “normal people” avoid or walk away from a homeless, mentally ill person on the street.

And the “bad people,” like sharks smelling blood, circle around, trying to devour you.

In conclusion, I know what it feels like to be CANCELLED by everyone—online and offline. And I know I’m not the only one. We are the silenced victims of modern times and social media. We are the shadow-banned by society.

There are three ways to deal with this:

1. Stay safe offline: Live offline, use Tails OS for surfing, cut ties with everyone, don’t trust anyone, and stick to yourself.
2. Build your own space: Create a site, forum, or community on the web to offer others a “safe place” away from toxic, abusive online behavior.
3. Stop worrying and focus on yourself: Let the haters hate, let the players play, and do what you believe is right for you.

Just remember: **“The more they hate you, the more you’re right about something.”**
