"YOU CAN WRITE POEMS ALL YOU WANT AND YOU CAN LEARN TO CODE ALL YOU WANT - YOU CAN TRY TO DO ANYTHING YOU WISH WITH YOUR TIME - HOWEVER IT'S MEANINGLESS THE WORLD WILL LOOK AT YOU AND WILL ONLY SEE A SCHIZO A MENTALLY ILL WORTHLESS PIECE OF HUMAN SHIT - THAT'S ALL YOU CAN BE IN THIS WORLD" (_danny - 2009_)

sometimes i wake up in the morning and ask myself why do i even bother? usually i go back to sleep till the afternoon...

for 14 (or was it 17?) years i wrote poetry and tried to publish them - why? cause i was dumb i actually believed someone gives a shit about me and my stupid poems or books - same thing with coding and programming i study hard for like 7 - 8 years to learn to code stupid games and chatbot (before chatGPT had all the answers) cause i thought if i could make my dumb dream come true someone will notice and want to be my friend or value me...

i've wasted my time and my life with online scums and creeps just to learn to code - today i ask myself was it worth it? to "give a dam" about my dreams in a world that don't give a fuck about me...

this worlds wants me as a dying homeless metally ill loser on the streets - freezing to death or jumping off some bridge to my death... ("nobody loves you when you are down and out nobody sees you when you ae old and gray everybody loves you when you six feet in the ground..." - John Lenon)

this world doesn't care about me this world doesn't need me this world doesn't want me...

living for most of my life under the mental illness stigma being rejected and kicked out everywhere like a dog by everyone - i might not be a homeless person (yet) but socially i'm dead and isolated - all i learn from the world and all what the world has thought me is self hatred and abuse and trauma - what have i learned if not to believe there are no good people in this world?...

computer programming? poetry? fuck that! let AI generate your porn-culture (and then wonder why you hate yourself and your life)

i had a few friends when i was young but they where not real friends... they were just "playing me" - no true love no friends no family no nothing... a complete waste of life...

then when you reach age 30 or 40 you rush to "do things right" and make something from yourself just to find out that it's too late that all the gates are closed and you are doomed - no salvation for you no recovery for you no miricale for you no nothing not kindness nor love nor compassion - just evil psychopaths abuse and a destroyed lost soul...

this is my site and my blog i can post whatever i want on it - but nobody is listening anyway...

the online internet just make it worse i think i could have been better off if the internet was not invented online internet and social media just makes things worse for me 

honestly why do i even bother? like who cares? right? think about it! WHY DO YOU EVEN BOTHER? LIKE WHO CARES ABOUT YOU? NOBODY! bottom line what's true for me is true for just about everyone the only difference is that most people LIVE WITH THEIR EGO STUCK SO DEEP IN THEIR ASS they can't see it... most people believe they're "special" "uniqee" "one of a kind" most people think they are god's gift to the universe most people think they have "rights" god given "rights" they can't see the truth THAT MOST OF THE WAY THEY SEE THEMSELVES AND WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS BULLSHIT! cause they are so full of themselves...

AS FOR ME I KNOW THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS "RIGHTS" there's just temporary privileges that can be taken from you at anytime striping you from everything and taking from you everything you got and everything worth living - one day you are a human being a person in the world a citizen next you are a social outcast or a prisoner or a homeless nobody with nothing just the clothes on your back "rights" are a thing of the past the future is horrible (aging getting old and sick and dying in a world that don't give a dam about you or hates you)

i don't care to bother remembering the assholes i met online in chatrooms on forums and social media on online communities each one was a real snowflack or a mixture of narcissisem egoisem and psychopathia it's no wonder i prefer to chat with AI then real people - real people are the devil to me...

so... why did i pick up poetry then programming in the first place? why do i bother?... it's simple - ONCE LIFE CRUSHES YOU AND FATE STEP ON YOU AND DESTROYS WHO YOU WERE - you have to get up pick yourself up by all means and try the best you can to reinvent yourself by all means necessary in order to survive in this fucked up world...

poetry then programming was something i could call my own in a time and place that my identity was erased and my purpose in life reached a dead end - it was an instinct of survival a reflex of my soul - like a man grasping a branch to hold on to in order not to fall down... it had nothing to do with what others say or think about it - online communities and crap and shit from online starngers did not play a role in my decision to embrace them initially - all that crap came after not before - and in the begining my poetry and so did my programming was pure and sincere and innocent - only when i wanted the world's recognition all the fakeness started and people showed their true nature of evilness...

MORE MAYBE NEXT POST -lets see how i feel tomorrow...
